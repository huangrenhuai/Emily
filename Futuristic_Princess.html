<h1>Futuristic Princess
#1
The Scorcher Fortune</h1>
<h3>
Written & Illustrated Emily Huang

<p>
	Arietta was a princess, a princess that was living in the future. In the year 3549, Arietta wanted to follow her 
	own dreams. Her own destiny. She was bored of giving speeches, staying in her room, studying history, and she felt
	 so alone. Living in the castle of Mariette was boring to her. She wanted to get out of the castle, and be able to 
	 do what she wanted. She was bored of this entire deal with princess stuff. She didn&apos;t want to be trapped in this 
	 castle. She never thought that pursuing her destiny would be so hard. So one day, she knew what she had to do. She 
	 would sneak out the castle, and no one could stop her.
</p>
<p>
Arietta got on a costume, a costume of a designer. She knew that her mom and dad had invited a designer to make an outfit 
for Carina, for the ball on Friday. She would dress up as the designer and sneak out of the castle. I&apos;m going to do it!!!
 Arietta thought to herself. But just as Arietta walked out the front door, she heard a guard shout, <q>Halt! The designer
  has already left. You are a fake!</q> He examined Arietta and found that she had a ruby bracelet, a bracelet Arietta
   always wore. He recognized it immediately. <q>You are Arietta! Your father has given commands for you to stay in the
    castle. You are unable to exit.</q> He leaded Arietta back to her room. When Arietta went back in, the guard slammed 
    the door shut. 
</p>
<p>
	She walked over to the window and plopped on to a velvet chair, peering out into the city of Mariette. 
     <q>How fun life would be outside of the castle walls,</q> Arietta said to herself. <q>I would do anything to get
      out of here.</q> She sighed, and then adjusted her tiara. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Just then, she heard a knock on her door.  <q>Come in, </q> Arietta said. It was her mom, Queen Isabella. 
	She entered the room. King Stephen was the king, who was also Arietta&apos;s dad.
	</p>
	<p>
	Arietta&apos;s mom sat down on another velvet chair. They stared at each other. Arietta squirmed in her chair, 
	afraid that her mom knew about what happened earlier in the day. But when Arietta&apos;s mom broke the silence, 
	it wasn&apos;t about what had happened. <q>Arietta, you need to get ready for the ball. I don&apos;t know what you have 
	been doing, but you need to get out of that designer&apos;s suit. I understand your love of designing, but you need 
	to act like a proper princess.</q> 
	<p>
	<q>Yes mom,</q> Arietta said. She stood up and walked to her wardrobe. She grabbed a sparkly lavender gown. 
	<q>How about this one?</q> She asked.
	</p>
<p>
	<q>Magnificent!</q> Her mom said. <q>Now hurry up! The ball is in five hours, and Carina is already ready.</q> Then she got 
	up and walked out of Arietta&apos;s room. 
	Arietta pulled on her gown and pinned her long blonde hair into a bun. She put on a pearl necklace and a velvety 
	jacket. With nothing else to do, she started reading. She loved designing and reading. She grabbed a book on art
	 and designing. She heard the snoring of her kitten Moonlight. She took Moonlight from the ground and put her on
     the bed in her room. She started reading her book, from where she left off.
	</p>
<p>
She thought about the castle her parents were going to build. It would be a little castle on Leafer Hill.  
Her parents owned a huge fortune, the Scorcher Fortune. It was going to be highly protected, with guards 
everywhere. But even as Arietta went on in her life, she was about to encounter a big problem, a surprising 
thing that she was about to find out.
</p>
<p>
As Arietta read her book, she heard a knock on her door. <q>Come in,</q> She said. It was Clarissa Lander, her best friend. 
She had a strange expression on her face. Clarissa&apos;s dad was one of the many Duke&apos;s of Mariette, and she lived in a 
mossy castle named the Lander Towers, near the Mariette castle. 
</p>
<p>
<q>What&apos;s wrong?</q> Arietta asked. She looked curiously at Clarissa. Clarissa was silent for a moment. 
</p>
<p>
After a little, she said, <q>It&apos;s something serious, and I don&apos;t know how to prevent it from happening.</q> 
She paused, and then continued. <q>Helena, the sorceress, from Storm City, is plotting against us, and she is 
trying to steal the Scorcher Fortune, the fortune that your parents own.</q> 
</p>
<p>
<q>What?!</q> Arietta answered, looking surprised. <q>If Helena steals the Scorcher Fortune, then The City of Mariette
 won&apos;t be able to grow!! My parents won&apos;t be able to build any more neighborhoods and other things!   How did you
  find out anyway?</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Well, yesterday, when Carina came to play with Lauralie and they went out into the Great Fields and were playing 
with their robots.</q> Lauralie was Clarissa&apos;s sister. Clarissa paused once again.
	<q>I remember,</q> Arietta said. <q>Carina is so lucky. She can go out of the castle walls and I can&apos;t. She&apos;s 
	only seven, 
	and I&apos;m twelve. I&apos;m older and I can&apos;t go out. My mom and dad probably hate me.</q> She slumped down into
	 her chair.
	</p>
<p>
	<q>Well, are you going to listen or not?</q> Clarissa asked. She waited patiently for an answer. 
<q>Yes, I will listen Clarissa.</q> Arietta replied. <q>Go on with the story please.</q> She sat up straight.
<q>Well, when they were playing, they saw a creepy looking castle. When they spotted it, they got all scared and ran back
 to the Lander Towers, and told my dad. My dad sent out spies to investigate and found out it was Raven Castle, in Storm 
 City. The spies sneaked into the castle, and brought back a few pieces of paper. The headline said, &apos;Plot on Mariette.&apos;
  The papers said to sneak into the new castle your parents are building and steal the fortune. It contained all the codes
   to get into the safe. I found out the castle belonged to Helena, when I asked my dad. Helena is plotting against you and
    your family. What can we do?</q> 
</p>
<p>
Arietta thought for a moment. Then she answered, <q>We have to go into Raven Castle to destroy those plans.</q> Arietta replaced 
her jacket with a black leathery cape and took off her tiara. She put on some sunglasses and pulled a hood onto her head. 
<q>How do I look?</q> She asked Clarissa.
<q>Great. From my research, the people living in Storm City always wear black. I&apos;m also dressed for the occasion.</q> Clarissa was 
a researcher. She wore a black sparkly gown and a black robe. She pulled out a pair of sunglasses and put them on. She twirled 
in her outfit. <q>By the way, that hair-do isn&apos;t right. People who live in Storm City have strict rules. You have to leave your
 hair down.</q> 
<q>Okay,</q> Arietta said, untwisting her bun. <q>Now we have to hurry. I have to go to a ball that&apos;s in a few hours. Are you going?</q> 
</p>
<p>
<q>Yes,</q> Clarissa answered. <q>There<q>s no more time to waste, so let&apos;s go.</q> They walked out of Arietta's room and headed 
toward Storm City.
</p>
<p>
They slipped out the doorway and past a few ballrooms and a living room. Suddenly they spotted Carina walking down 
the hall, right towards them. <q>Oh no!</q> Arietta whispered. They froze, and then quickly ducked behind a table. They 
held their breath as Carina walked by them. Just as Carina walked by, Clarissa sneezed. Carina stopped for a moment 
and looked behind her, but didn&apos;t spot any one. So then she continued walking.
</p>
<p>
When she turned the corner, they came out of their hiding spot. <q>Close one!</q> Arietta and Clarissa said in unison. 
They high-fived each other. Then they walked through a door and then came t</q>o the front room. 
</p>
<p>
Two guards stood at the entrance of the doorway, so Arietta hid behind Clarissa as she walked through the Main Gate.
 Then they walked over a drawbridge, and then past two more guards and out into the city. The guards nodded as Clarissa
  walked past. When they made it out the castle, Arietta handed Clarissa a small piece of metal with a button, speaker 
  and screen.
</p>
<p>
<q>Keep this with you,</q> Arietta said. <q>Press the red button to turn it on. Then you can speak from a distance and I can 
hear you. Also I will be able to see you from the screen.</q> They tucked the device into their pockets and turned east 
to face a dark looking castle. They knew danger was in Storm City, so the castle would be dangerous too. They heard 
legends that sometimes, people have died trying to sneak in. But they were not afraid. 
</p>
<p>
They entered into a black iron gate that was marked: Storm City. Carefully, they walked in, surprised to see almost
 everything was black, even the sky was a little dark. Everyone in the city wore a black cloak so you couldn&apos;t see
  their eyes. The city sure was dark and mysterious. They were both wearing black so no one knew they were outsiders.
   When they reached the castle, they paused.
</p>
<p>
<q>Look,</q> Arietta pointed at two dark figures standing at the doorway. <q>Guards.</q> 
</p>
<p>
The guards were holding Laser beams and flashlights. Suddenly, a flashlight pointed at them. <q>Quick!</q> Clarissa whispered. 
<q>Pretend we are Helena&apos;s assistants and act normal!</q> 
</p>
<p>
They confidently walked up to the guards and said, <q>We are assistants of Helena.</q> The guards nodded and lowered the moat. 
They walked across the moat and they entered a dark corridor. 
</p>
<p>
<q>We made it,</q> They breathed. Then they hurried down the hall.</p>
<p>

As they walked down the hall, they were too relieved to even talk to each other. Oh my gosh! Arietta thought.
 They halted when the path split. They turned on the speaking device and wished each other good luck. Then they 
 parted from each other. </p>
<p>
Arietta cautiously walked down the hall lit with torches. Then she came to a sign that said,
</p>
<p>
KEEP OUT!!!

	Arietta hesitated for a moment, and then continued on her journey. She checked the speaking device and called for Clarissa.
</p>
<p>	
<q>Clarissa?</q> Arietta said. She saw Clarissa turn around. 
</p>
<p>
	<q>Arietta,</q> Clarissa said hesitantly. <q>I found a secret door. Inside, there is a Ruby. Only one thing. 
	It&apos;s like as tall as me!!</q> 
	</p>
<p>
	<q>Really?</q> Arietta asked. <q>I haven&apos;t found anything except this Keep Out sign. Better get moving!</q> Arietta 
	closed her fingers on the device then continued down the hall. 
	</p>
<p>
	She walked for a while and then reached the end of the hall. There was a small door. Arietta entered and 
	found Helena was sitting on a bench and she was typing something. She looked up from her typing and then asked, 
	<q>Hello. Who may you be?</q> She gave her a suspicious look. 
</p>
<p>	
	<q>Hi,</q> Arietta said. <q>My name is umm….. Lily and I am one of your assistants.</q> Arietta breathed a sigh of relief. 
	</p>
<p>
<q>I've never had an assistant named Lily, so you must be new. What do want with me?</q> Helena asked, casting another 
suspicious look at Arietta. 
</p>
<p> 
<q>I can help you,</q> Arietta offered. 
</p>
<p>

<q>Okay. Guard the room when I am gone.</q> Helena said, slightly worried something would go wrong. Arietta nodded. 
Then Helena hurried out of the room. 
<q>I know the plans are on the computer.</q> Arietta announced to herself. <q>I&apos;m going to smash it up.</q> 
She put down the speaking device then pulled on some leather gloves. Arietta brought them in case. She learned
 how they could test D.N.A. She grabbed a hammer and then smashed up the computer.
</p>
<p>
Then she hurried out the room and grabbed the device as she met up with Clarissa. She ran down the corridor to 
reach the split in the path. Arietta was afraid Helena would find her. She heard the sound of her shoes hitting
 the concrete floor. She ran until she reached the spot Clarissa was waiting for her. 
</p>
<p>
<q>I can explain everything I discovered later, but we need to get out of here,</q> Clarissa told Arietta. They walked 
back to the entrance and walked across the moat. The guards waved goodbye as they walked away and they waved back.
 Then they ran back to Mariette city, where there wouldn&apos;t be danger or any fear, none at all.
</p>
<p>

When Arietta and Clarissa had not reached the castle yet, Carina sneaked into Arietta&apos;s room. Carina decided she 
would hide Arietta&apos;s tiara in the closet. She took it from the windowsill and stuffed it in the closet. 
</p>
<p>
Just as Carina was going to sneak away, Arietta and Clarissa burst through doorway. Arietta gave Carina a stern 
glare and Carina gave Arietta an innocent grin in return. Arietta&apos;s eyes looked from the windowsill back to Carina.
</p>
<p>
<q>Where is my tiara?</q> Arietta said, sounding frustrated. 
</p>
<p>
<q>It&apos;s in the closet,</q> Carina said back. Arietta walked over to the closet and gently picked up her tiara. Just as 
she picked up the tiara, a light bulb went on in her head. 
</p>
<p>
<q>I&apos;ve got it!</q> Arietta said, slightly screaming. <q>We can move the fortune to my Grandmother, just like you moved my 
tiara from the windowsill to the closet! Helena won&apos;t find out and even if she does, she won&apos;t be able to steal it. 
My grandmother has tons of guards at her castle.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Great idea, Arietta. Let&apos;s go tell your dad. Carina, get out of Arietta&apos;s room,</q> Clarissa commanded Carina. Carina 
saluted to them and marched out of the room.
</p>
<p>
<q>Okay, Clarissa. Tell me what you found in the castle and I&apos;ll tell you what I found, the we can go tell my dad,</q> 
Arietta said. They sat down on two chairs.
</p>
<p>
<q>Okay, well, I found a whole series of doors filled with treasures and gems.</q> Clarissa started. <q>The treasures all
 belonged to Helena, and I&apos;m guessing she already stole plenty of fortunes. We have to stop her this time.</q> Clarissa 
 had a determined look on her face. 
</p>
<p>
<q>We are going to stop her no matter what.</q> Arietta said. <q>Anyway, I found Helena&apos;s working office and I smashed up 
the computer containing the codes and plans to get through the walls of the castle. That&apos;s all I discovered.</q> 
</p>
<p>
<q>Good. Then Helena won&apos;t discover anything. Let&apos;s go tell your dad now.</q> Arietta took off her detective gear 
and then put on her tiara. They then walked out of Arietta&apos;s room to go to the throne room.
</p>
<p>
They knocked on the door to the throne room. <q>Enter!</q> Boomed King Stephen. They entered, and then curtsied. 
</p>
<p>
<q>Father,</q> Arietta started. <q>Helena is planning to steal the family fortune. I made a plan with Clarissa. Carina 
gave me the idea when she played a trick on me. We can move the fortune to Grandma. She has tons of guards.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Me and Arietta sneaked out of the castle and destroyed the plan files. Now we can move the fortune and have it
 protected.</q> 
</p>
<p>
<q>Sounds good to me,</q> King Stephen said surprised at Arietta&apos;s new boldness. He was so glad the fortune wouldn&apos;t 
be stolen, that he didn&apos;t care that Arietta snuck out the castle. <q>Tonight the ball will be in recognition of you,
 Arietta and Clarissa!</q> 
Just then, Queen Isabella walked in. <q>Time for the ball!</q> She said. Everyone followed her to the ballroom. 
</p>
<p>
King Stephen stepped out to the front. <q>Attention!</q> He said. The crowd became silent. <q>You are here today because 
of my daughter, Arietta and Clarissa. They have protected Mariette, my city.</q> Everyone cheered. Arietta stepped and 
Clarissa stepped onto the stage and curtsied. 
</p>
<p>
<q>Explain why you two have done this great deed.</q> King Stephen asked them. 
</p>
<p>
<q>Well,</q> Arietta started. <q>We did because we knew it would be good for the city. Without the Scorcher fortune, 
the city wouldn&apos;t be able to grow and get bigger.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>We knew in order to save the city; we would have to do this.</q> Clarissa said confidently. 
<q>Thank you girls,</q> King Stephen said. <q>To be awarded, I give you these.</q> He gave them both a box which they 
opened to find a 500 Carat diamond.
</p>
<p>
They both gasped. <q>Thank you,</q> They said, astonished. <q>Enjoy the ball!</q> They walked off with their new stones
 gripped tightly in their hands. Then they went over to King Stephen. 
<q>We will be transferring the fortune tomorrow,&apos;&apos; King Stephen announced. <q>So for now, your mission is complete!</q> 
</p>
<p>
So that brings our story to an end. So the two friends both learned, that they should do what would help 
others, and they would be honored greatly.
