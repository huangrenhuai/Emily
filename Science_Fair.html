<h1 > Science Fair Project: Sugar Crystal Growth </h1>
<hr/>

<p>My Science Fair Experiment was: Growing sugar crystals to finding out if they grow better in distilled 
water or tap water.</p>
<hr/>
 <h1 >Testable Question: </h1>
 <p>How does the type of liquid affect sugar crystal growth?
 
 </p>
 <hr/>
 
<h1>Hypothesis:</h1>

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;">I hypothesize that if you use distilled water to grow sugar crystals,
 then the crystals will grow bigger and better because distilled water is more pure and the water must be 
 pure for sugar crystals to grow well. </p>

<h1>Materials</h1>
<p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;"> 
You will need: two small cups,
 two pencils,
  two pieces of 20cm cotton string, 
 100ml of distilled water,
 100 ml of tap water,
 8.8 ml of sugar,
 a metal bowl,
a cup of boiled or hot water,
a stove,
a 58ml measuring cup
and 1 pitcher.
<hr/>
 </p>
<h1>Variables, Constants, & Trials:</h1>

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;">The Independent Variable is the type of water.
The Dependent Variable is to see how well sugar crystals grow with different
types of water used to grow the crystals.
The Constant Conditions are: the location, the time given, the amount of water, the length of string, 
the amount of sugar, the temperature, the cup size, and the number of trials.
The number of trials done was three.

<h1>Procedure to Follow</h1>
<p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;">  First, gather all the materials listed in the materials list.   
 Next, put the metal bowl on the stove and pour the cup of boiled water into the bowl. Then turn the stove on to high.
 Then, put the pitcher in the metal bowl and pour in the 100ml of tap water in the pitcher. 
 After that, stir 4.4ml of sugar into the 100ml of tap water in the pitcher until the water is saturated. 
 Pour the mixture into a small cup to about halfway.
 Next, tie one of the pieces of string to the pencil and dangle it in the water, making sure the string doesn't
 touch the sides of the small cup so the pencils resting on the sides of the cup.
 Repeat steps one through six but use 100ml distilled water in step three and four.
 After repeating the steps with distilled water, place a tissue over each cup and put the cups 
 in a location with no vibration. Record observations after letting the crystals grow for one week in the location.

<h1>Fun Books To Read</h1>
 
 <p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;">When I was in Fourth Grade, I wrote a fiction book called:
 Futuristic Princess, The Scorcher Fortune. Now, that book has become the first book in the series
 of books that I'm writing. I'm showing you a copy of it below this text. Read and enjoy this book!
  There is a link to my book under the text.

 <h1>My Diary</h1>
 
  <p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;"> January 20th, 2016: Today school was canceled because of the
  snow from last night. I was happy because I like to stay home on weekdays because it make me feel
  that day is extra special since usually on a weekday I&apos;m always in school.
  Today though, I really wanted to go to school because there was a math placement test for middle 
  school. I really wanted to just get over it and finish it today because tomorrow, I have 
  a field trip and I'm afraid it will get in the way of time. When I stayed home, 
  I did my regular things: Piano, Violin, Art, Reading, Writing, Math, Chinese,
  all the regular stuff I do after school on the normal weekdays. But today wasn't
  a normal day. I was out of school when it was supposed to be a day of school. It 
  was a snow day. Keyword:Snow. That means you play outside. So, that's just what I did. 
  First, I shoveled out the snow from the garage. Me and my sister use all that snow to make a 
  giant show mountain! Okay, it wasn't giant, and it wasn't such of a snow mountain,
  it was more of a hill. But a "Giant Snow Mountain" sounds
   a lot better. After, I made lunch with my sister. I made a 
   potato salad, a mixture of fish, and my dad made Ramen 
   noodles. That was about all the extra spe ail things that I did today.
   Oh yeah! The other thing is, I wrote to you. I want you
   to remember: when ever there are any updates to my blog, that's because it's a special day. 
   That means today is special. Goodnight, Diary, I'll write to soon. 
   
   January 23rd, 2016: Today was a day with lots of fun stuff. I first finished my stuff, like regular days.
   Then I went to the library, and after that, I went to swim practice. After I went home and ate lunch, I went
   to my sister Serena's friend's birthday party. It was at a roller skating place called rollercade.
   Now, I'm at my Chinese school. That's what I did today. Next, I get to go home and snuggle up and watch some movies,
   play games, all that fun stuff. Don't forget. Today is specail. Goodbye Diary. I have to leave.
