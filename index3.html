This is a picture of me working in the 
Gifted Program on my Newton's three laws 
of Motion Arcade Game. My game is like golf, but there is a
 swinging block to hit the ball instead of a mallet. It's a really fun game,
 but it is pretty challlenging. 
 I really enjoy playing this game that I made.

<p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;"> In the year 2015 on Christmas Day, 
my family went to central park to play. There was a new swing built in since 
the last time I went there. I tried it out, even if it was for younger kids.
It was really fun. I loved it. The next time I go there,
 I'll play on it again with Serena, my eight year old sister. I really liked it.
 It was lots of fun.

 <h1>My Diary</h1>
 
  <p style="color:MediumVioletRed ;"> January 20th, 2016: Today school was canceled because of the
  snow from last night. I was happy because I like to stay home on weekdays because it make me feel
  that day is extra special since usually on a weekday I&apos;m always in school.
  Today though, I really wanted to go to school because there was a math placement test for middle 
  school. I really wanted to just get over it and finish it today because tomorrow, I have 
  a field trip and I'm afraid it will get in the way of time. When I stayed home, 
  I did my regular things: Piano, Violin, Art, Reading, Writing, Math, Chinese,
  all the regular stuff I do after school on the normal weekdays. But today wasn't
  a normal day. I was out of school when it was supposed to be a day of school. It 
  was a snow day. Keyword:Snow. That means you play outside. So, that's just what I did. 
  First, I shoveled out the snow from the garage. Me and my sister use all that snow to make a 
  giant show mountain! Okay, it wasn't giant, and it wasn't such of a snow mountain,
  it was more of a hill. But a "Giant Snow Mountain" sounds
   a lot better. After, I made lunch with my sister. I made a 
   potato salad, a mixture of fish, and my dad made Ramen 
   noodles. That was about all the extra spe ail things that I did today.
   Oh yeah! The other thing is, I wrote to you. I want you
   to remember: when ever there are any updates to my blog, that's because it's a special day. 
   That means today is special. Goodnight, Diary, I'll write to soon. 
   
   January 23rd, 2016: Today was a day with lots of fun stuff. I first finished my stuff, like regular days.
   Then I went to the library, and after that, I went to swim practice. After I went home and ate lunch, I went
   to my sister Serena's friend's birthday party. It was at a roller skating place called rollercade.
   Now, I'm at my Chinese school. That's what I did today. Next, I get to go home and snuggle up and watch some movies,
   play games, all that fun stuff. Don't forget. Today is specail. Goodbye Diary. I have to leave.
